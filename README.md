###Hurricane Data Parsing

The NOAA currently has data on hurricanes and their various properties, dating back to 1851. The python program imports wind speeds, and uss those wind speeds along with the known intervals between observations to calculate Saffir-Simpson days per hurricane.

Hurricane data originally from hurdata.py.

consoleinput.txt has the commands necessary to generate plots graph/graph2.png based on the results of hurricanes.py
